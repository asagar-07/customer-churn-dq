This project simulates a real-world machine learning workflow where raw customer data is often incomplete, inconsistent, messy, or incorrect.

Key goals:
	•	Build a dirty data generation engine that systematically injects realistic corruption
	•	Develop a robust ETL pipeline to clean, standardize, and validate the messy dataset
	•	Train and evaluate ML models for customer churn prediction
	•	Compare model performance on:
	•	Clean raw data
	•	Messy data
	•	Cleaned (ETL-processed) messy data

This project showcases data engineering, data quality, ML modeling, and software design skills.
